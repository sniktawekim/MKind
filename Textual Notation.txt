\\\Needs.txt:
-In each folder there should be a "Needs.txt"
-This file is a log of what I need of each type.
-Notation should include date of need requested.
-When a need is "completed", mark the original request line with a 
	\ at the start.
-Unspecified amount needs (as in, no limit specified) should have sublines
	for when someone contributes to that need. These lines should
	begin with a \
-Partially finished requests should be marked similarly to the unspecified amount needs
-The need files will be updated with more requests. Each new request
	will be added to the beginning of the file, pushing the rest down.
