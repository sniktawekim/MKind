	I need short soundclips. Need to research best filetypes.
	I need clips for: bullet collisions with enemies, bullet collisions 	
	with player, beam collisions with enemy, beam ambient noise,
	rocket ignition noise, crashing noises, dying noises, shop repair 		
	noises, ship upgrade noises, item collecting noise.
