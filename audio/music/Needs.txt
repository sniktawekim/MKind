	I need a an Intro track. This song will be playing until the player		
	presses a button. It needs to have a start, and an end. It does not 	
	need to be able to loop into itself - as there will be silence 
	between its replaying. This should be between 1 and 3 minutes long.

	I need a Title track. This will play during the main menu after
	the player presses a button at the intro. This song should be able		
	to smootly loop. It should be between 1/2 and 3 minutes long.

	I need level tracks. These need to loop, and be between 1 and 3 		
	minutes long. A COUPLE of 1/2 and 5 minute long tracks also need to 	
	be made. Looping can be made easier if you make 2 tracks, one small 	
	one for the initial start (which will only play once), and one that 	
	starts as it ends for the loopback. Another trick to help with 
	looping would be having the song fade in and out with some 
	silence/ambient noise at the beginning and end.

	I need a credits track. This can be really long and should be at 		
	least 4 minutes long. Will not loop.
------------

	I need a gameover track. This should be between 10 and 40 seconds 		
	long, and will not loop.
------------

11.5.2013---
	I need a highscore track. This should be between 10 and 30 seconds 		
	long and needs to loop very smoothly without fading in/out.
------------

11.5.2013---
	I need a pause menu track. This can be between 1 and 6 minutes, and 	
	will loop, but can do so with fading.
