dont make the title yet, since I haven't decided one. 
If you have any ideas, go for it. 
Ideally, this will be a cool logo type picture instead of just words.
The logo needs to be its own picture.

I would like the background to be an animated gif, with planets/stars and even possible ships that fly in and out of frame.

Once again - each button needs 2 images, highlighted and non highlighted.
