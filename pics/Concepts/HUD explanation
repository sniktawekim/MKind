The stars are going to be the player's different ships, with the one he is currently using greyed out.
the bar in the middle is his health bar, green representing health remaining, red representing the last hit damage
and black representing missing health. The two numbers represent the money he has earned during that level, and
his score.

The health bar section is proportionally smaller than it should be here, it should be the largest section by far.

To make this hud, we will need to break it into parts - the background and the forground.
the background will just be the rectangles attached to eachother, the forground will be generated by 
the program dynamically.

For the background, I will need only 1 picture.

The forground:
-ships - you can just ignore these, I will implement this working properly
-health bar - i would like tiny pictures, 2x5, of each of the 3 colors. I want them all 
to be something similar to a gradient which slowly changes color from bottom to top. This way
I can stack a bunch of them horizontally and they will look like one image combined. 
-numbers - just a 0-9 of whatever font, or even some picture numbers that you could make. also a dollar symbol.
